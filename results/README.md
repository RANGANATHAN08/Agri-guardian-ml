🧪 Model Performance

The CNN-based detection model was evaluated under multiple environmental conditions, including daylight and low-light scenarios.

Key metrics:

Accuracy: ~90%

Precision: ~89%

Recall: ~94%

Real-time inference: ~30 FPS

False positives: Significantly reduced

⚙️ System-Level Results

The multi-stage alarm system was tested for its effectiveness:

Alarm Stage	Deterrent Type	Effectiveness
Stage 1	Visual (LED)	Moderate
Stage 2	Ultrasonic sound	High
Stage 3	Loud sound	Very High
Stage 4	Mechanical scare	Maximum

In most cases, pests were deterred before reaching Stage 4.

📷 Visual Outputs
